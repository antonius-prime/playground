This question is strictly for purpose of my learning Clojure, a homework
assignment.  Program is given a formula (proposition logic in this case,
infix notation) and it should manipulate it as symbolic formula. It
would need to change given formula to the formula in some other form and
so on. In Java, i would probably define token interface, a class for
every valid token and then represent the formula as a tree of token
instances and manipulate it.

I am new to clojure, lisp, functional programming.  When i tried to
solve it in Clojure i began doing the same thing using datatypes.
